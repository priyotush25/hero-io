### 🚀 Why this is better:

1.  **Badges:** I added tech-stack badges at the top. They make the repo look official and "Pro" immediately.
2.  **Callouts:** Used the `[!IMPORTANT]` block to make the Live Demo link impossible to miss. Recruiters usually look for this first.
3.  **Structured Sections:** Grouped the technical stack into "Core," "Styling," and "Development" to show you understand the role of each tool.
4.  **Emphasis:** Bolded key terms like "Component-Based Architecture" and "State Management" to catch the eye of technical reviewers.

**Next Step:** Ensure you upload the `screenshot.png` file to your GitHub repository folder so the image displays correctly.
